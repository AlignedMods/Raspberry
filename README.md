# Raspberry

## **NOTE:** Currently Visual Studio just doesn't work and I don't know why, if you know why feel free to tell me!

## How to build:

### **1: Prerequisites**

***Premake***

***Make*** or ***Visual Studio***

***Raylib*** (only dynamic for now, for now the code only works on windows and the library is included in the libs folder)

### **2: Building the source code**

To generate the build system you wish run:

    cd scripts
    .\build-make.bat        // For Windows
    ./build-make.sh         // For Linux
(for make)

**OR**

    cd scripts
    .\build-vs.bat
(for visual studio)
